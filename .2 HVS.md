# HVS (Human Visual System)

Your cornea and lens provide the focus, while the iris adjusts to let the optimal amount of light reach your retina. The retina converts the image formed by the light rays into nerve impulses. The optic nerve, composed of the axons of the retina's ganglion cells, then transmits these impulses from the eye to the first visual relay in the brain.

The cornea does not have any blood vessels, so it takes its nutrients from the aqueous humor behind it.

**Pupil** lets light reach the retina. The diameter of the pupil is controlled by the **iris**, a circular muscle.

**Pupillary reflex**: on a dark night, your pupils are big and black, because your irises open wide.
