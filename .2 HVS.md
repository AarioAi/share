# HVS (Human Visual System)

Your cornea and lens provide the focus, while the iris adjusts to let the optimal amount of light reach your retina. **The retina converts the image formed by the light rays into nerve impulses.** The optic nerve, composed of the axons of the retina's ganglion cells, then transmits these impulses from the eye to the first visual relay in the brain.

The cornea does not have any blood vessels, so it takes its nutrients from the aqueous humor behind it.

The **choriod**, a richly vascularized layer that delivers nutrients to the iris and the retina, contains many dark pigments that make the inside of the eye, as seen through the pupil, appear black.

The aqueous humor and the vitreous humor play an essential role in focusing the image on the retina.

**Pupil** lets light reach the retina. The diameter of the pupil is controlled by the **iris**, a circular muscle.

**Pupillary reflex**: on a dark night, your pupils are big and black, because your irises open wide.

## Optic Nerve

The axons of the retina's ganglion cells collect in a bundle at the optic disc and emerge from the back of the eye to form the **optic nerve**.

The optic nerves of the two eyes emerge from their optics discs and intersect at the **optic chiasm** just in front of the **pituitary gland**.

The axons from the nasal side of each retina cross sides in the optic chiasm so that the left halt of the field of vision is perceived by the right cerebral hemisphere, and vice versa. The axons from the non-nasal side proceed straight ahead through the **optic tract**.

The vast majority of the nerve fibres in the optic tract project to the LGN(lateral geniculate nucleus) in the dorsal part of the thalamus. The LGN is the first and the main relay in the pathway to the primary visual cortext. The projection from the LGN to the visual cortext is called the **optic radiation**. Because damage at any point along the pathway from the retina to the cortex results in some degree of blindness.

## Visual Cortex

It is in the **primary visual cortex** (striate cortext or V1) that the brain begins to reconstitute the image from the **receptive fields** of the cells of teh retina. The V1 cortex is located in the most posterior portion of the brain's occipital lobe.
